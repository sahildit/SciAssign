# Description of the Assignment
==============================
This assignment is about to create the user interface for sci-fi idea which can be used in any sci-fi movie. It was done in language called java and processing. My User Interface is Space Ship control panel and this idea came from Avengers (Ender's Game) when iron man is stuck in ship. So, then i decided to make interface like that but mine is slightely different. Through this assignment i learnt alot not only how to code and improve skills but also how to work/manage time under pressure ( as we were having other assignments at the same time).

# Instructions 
==============
The User must compile and run the program, the screen ( first screen) will be displayed which has background image of space and an loading bar. 
When loading bar gonna finish it will prompt the user to new screen and that's my main screen. The main screen contains Three buttons. First, an Launch button which will launch the features of ship, Second, Shutdown button will make features stop working and Third, Exit button will close the file and brings user to git again if he/she wants to start all over again. One important thing is that user can't exit the program untill unless he/he launch the program.
