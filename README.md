#Description of the Assignment
==============================
This assignment is about to create the user interface for sci-fi idea which can be used in any sci-fi movie. It was done in language called java and processing. My User Interface is Space Ship control panel and this idea came from Avengers (Ender's Game) when iron man is stuck in ship. So, then i decided to make interface like that but mine is slightely different.
